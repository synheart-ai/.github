# 🫀 **Synheart AI**

**Heart-driven intelligence for emotionally aware systems.**  
Synheart merges human **biosignals** with **neural networks** — building AI that senses how you feel and adapts in real time.

## 🌍 What is Synheart?

Synheart is an open research and product platform exploring how **physiological signals** — heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and temperature — can guide **AI systems that respond with emotional context**.

Our goal:  
→ Create **AI that feels your rhythm**, not just reads your words.

## ⚙️ Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| 🖥️ **Engine** | Python/FastAPI microservice that processes biosignals (HRV, EDA, Temp, Motion) |
| 💬 **AI Core** | OpenAI-compatible LLM layer augmented with physiological embeddings |
| 📱 **App** | Flutter + Apple Watch client for real-time data streaming and visualization |
| ☁️ **Infra** | Docker, AWS Lambda, Terraform templates for scalable deployment |

---

## 🚀 Get Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter ≥ 3.22  
- Python ≥ 3.10  
- OpenAI-compatible API key  

### 1️⃣ Clone and bootstrap
```bash
git clone https://github.com/synheart-ai/synheart.git
cd synheart
```

### 2️⃣ Start the engine
```bash
cd services/engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3️⃣ Run the app
```bash
cd ../../apps/mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🧠 Example: Use HRV in Your Own Project

```python
from synheart.engine import compute_hrv

rr_intervals = [800, 780, 810, 790, 805, 795]
features = compute_hrv(rr_intervals)
print(features)
# {'rmssd': 34.2, 'sdnn': 41.8, 'pnn50': 0.33, 'state': 'focused'}
```
