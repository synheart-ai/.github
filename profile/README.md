## 🌌 About
Synheart isn’t your regular AI lab.  
We’re a collective of coders, dreamers, and cardiac philosophers trying to teach machines one impossible thing — **to feel**.

We believe the heart isn’t just a biological pump.  
It’s the original neural network, firing coherence before CPUs existed.  
And we’re here to sync it with silicon.

Our mission:  
> 💓 Fuse biosignals with neural networks to create **heart-driven intelligence**.  

(Yes, we actually mean it. No, we’re not a cult. Yet.)

## ⚙️ What We Build
Think of Synheart as a multi-disciplinary orchestra:
- 🕊 **Synheart App** — A Flutter + Apple Watch experience that listens to your heart and vibes with your emotions.
- 🔬 **Synheart Engine** — The bio-signal pipeline that transforms HRV into features AI can meditate on.
- 🤖 **Synheart Models** — Fine-tuned LLMs that don’t just autocomplete — they empathize.
- ☁️ **Synheart Cloud** — Secure APIs, data sanctuaries, and model gateways powered by Rust, Go, and Python.
- 📊 **Synheart Analytics** — We quantify the ineffable. Redshift, Python, and vibes.

## 🧠 Philosophy (aka the weird part)
> "The brain computes.  
> The heart communicates.  
> The soul negotiates."

We explore **RLHHF — Reinforcement Learning from Human Heart Feedback**,  
because why should machines only learn from clicks and stars when they could learn from beats per minute?

Our hypothesis:  
If AI can sense when you’re stressed, joyful, or deeply chill —  
it can adapt its responses in real time.  
Less “I’m sorry, I don’t understand” and more “Hey, breathe.”

## 🧘 Tech Stack Karma
- **Frontend:** Flutter, Tailwind, and caffeine  
- **Backend:** Rust / Go / Laravel / Python (depends on who’s enlightened that day)  
- **Data Temple:** Amazon Redshift, S3  
- **Models:** LLaMA, Hugging Face, OpenAI APIs  
- **Infra:** AWS Lambda, CloudFront, Docker, prayers

## 💾 Install (for the brave)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/synheart-ai/synheart-engine
cd synheart-engine
poetry install
make meditate
```

If something breaks, it’s probably Mercury retrograde.
Try again after a deep breath.



## 🧩 Architecture
---- 
👀 Apple Watch → 🧮 Engine → 🧠 Model → ❤️ Feedback → ☯️ Alignment

Each beat counts.
Literally.



## ⚡️ MVP Manifesto
	•	We build fast, but with intention.
	•	We respect both data and the Dao.
	•	We believe every 404 is just a lost soul trying to reconnect.
	•	Our uptime goal: 99.999% coherence.



## 🧪 Contributing

- PRs welcome.
- Bug reports accepted.
- Existential questions encouraged.

```bash
# fork the repo
git clone your-own-heart.git
# open your mind
code .
# make something feel
```

Before you open a PR, ask yourself:

> “Does this add coherence or chaos to the collective heartbeat?”



## 🛐 Ethics & Privacy

We guard biosignals like sacred texts.
Everything is anonymized, encrypted, and blessed with end-to-end empathy.
No creepy tracking. Only conscious data.
